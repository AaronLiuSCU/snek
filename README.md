snek
Includes the .rs and cargo files for a playable snake game. To install, create a new rust project and paste the files into the project folder and build. 
use keyboard arrows to control snake character direction. 
red blocks extend the snake's length by one.
yellow blocks extend the snake's length by two.
green blocks are poles. If you hit them it is game over.
rainbow blocks are special- it grants you invincibility so you can destroy green blocks or come in contact with its own body without having game over.
the goal is to keep the snake alive by avoiding barriers, poles, and coming in contact with itself. Have fun!
